> I have developed **"Career Management Extension"**. It is very useful for the **students, employees** as you can access all your **application links, applied links, study material, resume, status of applied links** at one place. Inshort this mini portal for you to track everything at one place.


After adding this extension to the google chrome  all the open tabs will be visible inside the extension with save button. When you are saving the tab,  select a category of the tab.

People can save these tabs inside below categories:
* Application Link
* Career Page
* Job Dashboard
* Study Material
* Resume Link

Adding it to above categories, it will go to to-do list and once task is completed , you can move it to completed task.
